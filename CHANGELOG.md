# dbt_stripe_source v0.6.0
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Bug fix in which the `subscription` table didn't match the most recent [Stripe ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zyxgbaOjgBt3NsY0OfsiGsWDIefcBc-R1lHWlMltCYU/edit#slide=id.gd0264d4694_14_1). The table and relevant tests/project information have now been updated to reference the new `subscription_history` source table. Before upgrading, please ensure your Stripe connector includes the `subscription_history` table. ([#37](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source/pull/37))
## Features
- Includes a new variable `stripe__keep_subscription_history` which allows users to enable or disable the historical records within the `subscription` models. By default this variable is set to `false` and will only include active records within the `stg_stripe__subscription` model. ([#38](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe_source/pull/38))

# dbt_stripe_source v0.5.1

## Under the Hood
- Addresses a bug in which timestamp columns in the `balance_transaction` source table are brought in as `timestamp with time zone` on Redshift and Postgres, which caused downstream datatype errors. These columns are now always cast as `timestamp without time zone` in the staging `balance_transaction` model ([#22](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_stripe/issues/22)).

# dbt_stripe_source v0.5.0

ðŸŽ‰ dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility ðŸŽ‰
## ðŸš¨ Breaking Changes ðŸš¨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. The latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.
